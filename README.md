# go-docker-compose

Example application demonstrating how to use Docker compose with Go applications. The repository contains a simple application written in Golang that contains a single API to display the "Quote of the day".

The app fetches the quote of the day from a public API hosted at `http://quotes.rest/`, then it caches the result in Redis. For subsequent API calls, the app will return the result from Redis cache instead of fetching it from the public API.

Clone the repository -

Open 3 powershells and ssh into ubuntu running on vagrant on each of them-

$ vagrant ssh 

In terminal 1, start the docker service: 

$ sudo dockerd --debug

In terminal 2, start the app -
```bash
$ docker-compose up
```
In terminal 3, hit the primary endpoint -

$ curl http://localhost:8080/qod
```bash
If I work as hard as I can, I wonder how much I can do in a day?
```
